# Smart Construction Planner

An AIâ€‘assisted toolkit for dataâ€‘driven site design. It fuses pedestrian flow, geospatial context, utilities, traffic, and weather to forecast demand, assess accessibility, and surface risks. Planners get fast, practical recommendations and whatâ€‘if analysis to design safer, more inclusive public spaces with confidence.

## Key Features
- Pedestrian & Accessibility Insights: Optimizes layouts for safe and inclusive movement.
- Geospatial Data Integration: Leverages maps, mobility data, and urban utility patterns.
- AI & ML Algorithms: Predicts demand, flow, and optimal structural layouts.
- Real-Time Data Awareness: Considers live traffic and weather data to ensure safety and efficiency.
- Faster Decision-Making: Helps stakeholders plan and execute construction more effectively.
