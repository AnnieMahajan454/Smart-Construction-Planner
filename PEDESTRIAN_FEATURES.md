- View alternative routes for high-priority blocked paths
- Each alternative includes:
  - Route description and difficulty level
  - Additional distance and time required
  - Safety rating for the alternative path
  - Visual color coding based on difficulty

## 📊 Understanding the Data

### Severity Levels
- **🔴 High**: Significant impact on pedestrian movement, major delays expected
- **🟡 Medium**: Moderate impact, some delays and detours required
- **🟢 Low**: Minor impact, minimal delays

### Safety Levels for Construction Sites
- **🟢 Safe**: Normal pedestrian access with basic safety measures
- **🟡 Caution**: Extra care required, some safety risks present
- **🔴 Dangerous**: Extreme caution needed, high safety risks

### Impact Types
- **Complete Block**: Path is entirely closed to pedestrians
- **Partial Block**: Path is partially accessible with restrictions
- **Detour Available**: Main path blocked but official detour provided

## Supported Cities

The pedestrian features are available for all 8 major Indian cities:
- **Mumbai** - Maharashtra (High traffic, monsoon-prone)
- **Delhi** - Delhi NCR (High traffic, moderate weather risk)
- **Bangalore** - Karnataka (Moderate traffic, tech hub)
- **Chennai** - Tamil Nadu (Coastal weather, industrial)
- **Hyderabad** - Telangana (Growing metro, moderate conditions)
- **Kolkata** - West Bengal (Cultural capital, monsoon-heavy)
- **Pune** - Maharashtra (IT hub, moderate traffic)
- **Ahmedabad** - Gujarat (Industrial, low weather risk)

## 💡 Tips for Pedestrians

### Safety First
- Always check high-priority alerts before traveling
- Pay attention to construction site working hours (typically 7 AM - 7 PM)
- Use recommended alternative routes when main paths are blocked
- Stay updated with real-time information before starting your journey

### Plan Ahead
- Add extra time to your journey based on delay estimates
- Check the map to identify all affected areas along your route
- Consider alternative routes that might be safer or faster
- Be prepared for temporary closures that might change daily

### Using the Map Effectively
- Zoom in for detailed street-level information
- Click on markers to get comprehensive construction details
- Use the legend to understand different color codes
- Plan your entire route considering multiple potential blocks
